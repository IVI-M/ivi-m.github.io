<!-- ar[19] = "Whether one is rich or poor, educated or illiterate, religious or non-believing, man or woman, black, white, or brown, we are all the same. Physically, emotionally, and mentally, we are all equal. We all share basic needs for food, shelter, safety, and love. We all aspire to happiness and we all shun suffering. Each of us has hopes, worries, fears, and dreams. Each of us wants the best for our family and loved ones. We all experience pain when we suffer loss and joy when we achieve what we seek. On this fundamental level, religion, ethnicity, culture, and language make no difference."

â€œLet us try to recognize the precious nature of each day.â€

â€œEvery day, think as you wake up: Today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it.â€

â€œThe goal is not to be better than the other man, but your previous self.â€

â€œConsider carefully: what prevents you from living the way you want to live your life?â€

â€œAs you breathe in, cherish yourself. As you breathe out, cherish all beings.â€

â€œLove and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.â€

â€œOur prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you canâ€™t help them, at least donâ€™t hurt them.â€

â€œPeace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there. Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means; through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways.â€

â€œThe whole purpose of religion is to facilitate love and compassion, patience, tolerance, humility, and forgiveness.â€

â€œOnly the development of compassion and understanding for others can bring us the tranquility and happiness we all seek.â€

â€œCompassion is the radicalism of our time.â€

â€œCompassion naturally creates a positive atmosphere, and as a result you feel peaceful and content.â€

â€œLove and compassion are the true religions to me. But to develop this, we do not need to believe in any religion.â€

â€œThe topic of compassion is not at all religious business; it is important to know it is human business, it is a question of human survival.â€

â€œIf you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion.â€

â€œSometimes one creates a dynamic impression by saying something, and sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent.â€

â€œWhere ignorance is our master, there is no possibility of real peace.â€

â€œThe way to change othersâ€™ minds is with affection, and not anger.â€

â€œRemember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck.â€

â€œAn open heart is an open mind.â€

â€œThere is a saying in Tibetan, â€˜Tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength.â€™ No matter what sort of difficulties, how painful experience is, if we lose our hope, thatâ€™s our real disaster.â€

â€œIt is very rare or almost impossible that an event can be negative from all points of view.â€

â€œShare your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immortality.â€

â€œHappiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.â€

â€œChoose to be optimistic, it feels better.â€

â€œA disciplined mind leads to happiness, and an undisciplined mind leads to suffering.â€

â€œBe kind whenever possible. It is always possible.â€

â€œGive the ones you love wings to fly, roots to come back, and reasons to stay.â€

â€œThe more you are motivated by love, the more fearless and free your action will be.â€

â€œLove is the absence of judgment.â€

â€œLove and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.â€

â€œWe can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection.â€
